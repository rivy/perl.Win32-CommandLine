rules:

1) token not-glob and matches filename -> change to /'s
2) token globbed -> change to /'s
3) nullglob = false
	globbed tokens without a match => <original token> (** without / changes)
4) nullglob = true
	globbed tokens without a match => '' (** EXCEPT special case of ~ or ~<name> => stays as the original token, NO / changes)
	

** ONLY successfully globbed tokens will have path seperator changes
** 
	
- can use parallel tokens while figuring out globbing

- when dosify'ing
	special case (for legacy DOS commands which can't take their options quoted) => if leading '/' use 's:^(/\w*)(.*)$:$1\"$2\":' to quote the string
