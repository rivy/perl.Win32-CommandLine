if perl is aliased to 'x perl ...' then installs will fail with:
	"ppm install failed: Can't rename as C:/Perl/site/bin/x.bat.ppmbak: Permission denied"
because x.bat is in use and can't be renamed
ppm is a batch file which uses perl internally ... so an alias to 'x perl ...' will keep x.bat in use while executing the install command

workaround: unalias perl
re-run "build install" or "ppm install Win32-Command..."

* ADD this notation to the suggestion to alias perl to ... 
	- maybe, in the future, perl could be compiled with this module in mind to avoid the need to alias it...
	
* MAYBE make a customized BUILD.PL to check for this (or maybe check for any installable exe's/bat's that may be in use)
